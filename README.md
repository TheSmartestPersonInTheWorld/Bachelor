code for my bachelors thesis in numercal solutions of the time-dependent schrodinger equation

Most/all code for numerical calculations is in the aptly named "workhorse" script.
Cope to plot, present, and animate is in the "ploting" script

The different notebooks are each dedicated to looking at a certain kind of system, and contains code and variables specific to those systems.
